 * The congestion control is splitted from the main socket code, and it is a 
 * pluggable component. An interface has been defined; variables are maintained
 * in the QuicSocketState class, while subclasses of QuicCongestionOps operate 
 * over an instance of that class.
 *
 * The design extends TcpNewReno to provide compatibility with the TCP congestion 
 * control implementations, as well as the possibility of extending it with new
 * QUIC-related capabilities.
